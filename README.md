# A test application for checking skills

In this project you will find :
* Clean architecture
* MVVM approach for presentation layer
* **[Koin](https://insert-koin.io/)** for dependency injection approach
* **[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)** for networking
* **[Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)** for asynchronous operations
* **[Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html)** for observer pattern implementation
* **[Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)** for observer pattern implementation

## What is it not?

* A tests. did not have enough time for implementing it.
* A Jetpack Compose. I feel more confident using XML layouts but I try to study it because anyway it is perspective technology.
* A multi modules approach. I think it's overkill for the test app.
* A coordinator layout for UserDetails screen. I think it is a good idea to improve user experience.
